# World-Disaster-Map
World Disaster Map is an open sourced AngularJs version of the Emergency and Disaster Information Service website [http://hisz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/index2.php]

### Running the app
Switch into the "frontend" directory and run the command:

    http-server
    
### Development Plans
THe goal of this project is to get a fully functioning Angular App running that will consume and display data from the 
Emergency and Disaster Information Service Api. 

Eventually, I would like live-stream the data via sockets.
